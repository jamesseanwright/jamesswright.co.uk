[*Implementing AppFog*](https://www.packtpub.com/implementing-appfog-guide-on-deploying-applications-to-cloud/book?utm_source=jamesswright.co.uk&utm_medium=Book+Page&utm_campaign=Implementing+AppFog) is an invaluable book that details how technologists can deploy software to the cloud in a matter of minutes. As cloud services are becoming popular among developers and DevOps engineers for their cost, ease of use, and flexibility, this publication concisely demonstrates creating and modifying hosted applications and services via the web console and the command line interface. Combined with a detailed command line reference, this book is appropriate for beginners and AppFog veterans alike.

As a user of the service, the book has made me aware of some really powerful features, which I plan to use in my next deployment. I highly recommend it.
