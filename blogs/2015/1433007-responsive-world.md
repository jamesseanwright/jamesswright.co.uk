## Entering the responsive world!

<time datetime="2015-05-30">30th May 2015</time>

After 7 months of hard work (read: 7 months of small, gradual steps), my new responsive website is finally in production! Rather than derail this post into some sentimental thank you speech (just kidding!), I'm glad to finally have a website that can supersede my Tumblr blog, and that I hope will serve as a superiour representation of my work. That said, there are still some posts that I wish to port over from my old blog before it is fully decommisioned.

The site has been developed in valid and semantic HTML5, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and JavaScript, as well as Node.js and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on the backend. Additionally, this blog is powered by [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown), because Markdown is awesome.

I've tried to make the site as SEO-friendly and accessible as possible; feedback on the latter, in particular, would be of great interest to me.

Of course it's still in its infancy, so please don't hesitate to get in touch if you notice any bugs; I've endeavoured to be an effective tester, but occassionally things do slip through. It would be very much appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!
