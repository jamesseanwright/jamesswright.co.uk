## You Ain't Heard Nothing Yet! A 5-Part Screencast Series on the Web Audio API

<time datetime="2016-09-25">25th September 2016</time>

I've spent quite a bit of time this year experimenting with the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), mainly for implementing a small music schema I've authored named [NanoTunes](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/nanotunes), as well as for generating sound effects for my games. So when I was approached by SitePoint to author a screencast series, I naturally chose this topic.

The full, 5-part series is only available to SitePoint Premium customers, but you can [watch the first episode](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/screencasts/an-introduction-to-the-web-audio-api) for free. After introducing the API, the following episodes cover some of the available effects, integrating with the [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API), and synthesising sound.

It's amazing what browsers can do these days!
