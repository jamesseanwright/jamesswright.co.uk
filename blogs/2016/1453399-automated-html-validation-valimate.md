Happy new year!

As a standards nut, I often endorse serving valid HTML. After having implemented an automated solution at work, which HTTP GETs our web app's HTML and sends it to the [Nu HTML Checker](https://github.com/validator/validator), I released [Valimate](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/valimate); it's a command line interface developed in Node.js that validates a configured list of URLs.

You can read about it, and the motivations behind it, in [an article](https://medium.com/@jamesseanwright/automatically-validate-html-with-node-js-and-valimate-196c71a349bf#.wg3pz6m1a) that I recently published on Medium.
